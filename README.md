# FlightTrackerLive
Live ADS-B and Live ATC communications display application.
We later intend to add proper GUI, and have further plans to develop this into both a web version and android app

**Abstract**
Utilising opensourse aircraft monitoring databases including but not limited to ADS-B, we intend to replicate commercial flight tracking software such as FlightRadar24, ADS-B Exchange, and FlightAware. 
Furthermore, we intend to implement (close to) real-time ATC frequency monitoring like that of LiveATC within the application for easy access to the general public who lack standalone devices to monitor the aviation air band.

Later versions to include AR or 3D models of aircrafts, annual 'Wrapped' analysis of user logged personal flight records, additional 'fancy' graphics of flight info, and flight alerts

-starting Jan. 2025
